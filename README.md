# Design Patterns
This repo contains examples of common OOP design patterns.

## Factory

The program will produce an array of random numbers. The user chooses the size of the array. Then, the program gives the user a choice of various sort methods. After the user chooses a method, the program uses the *factory pattern* to create an instance of a class that sorts the array according to the method that the user chose. Output shows how long it took to sort the array.
