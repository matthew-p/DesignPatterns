# Design Patterns
This repo contains examples of common OOP design patterns.

## Creational Patterns

### Simple Factory

The program will produce an array of random numbers after the user chooses the size of the array. Then, the program gives the user a choice of various sort methods. After the user chooses a method, the program uses the *simple factory* pattern to create an instance of a class that sorts the array according to the method that the user chose. Output shows how long it took to sort the array.

### Builder

Choose a character from among several interesting options, and the program will build and describe it. You can create your own character too--simply make a class that implements `AbstractCharacterBuilder`.

### Prototype

This is a simple implementation of the prototype pattern.
